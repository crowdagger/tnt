Tiny 'Nux Tarot
===============

Features
--------

-   Basic tarot rules implemented, but special cases are missing
    ("poignee", "misere", "petit au bout")
-   Four-player (human or IA) only
-   Possibility to have multiple human players on the same computers.
    That's not really great because one player might see the hand of
    other ones, but well...\
-   Very basic IA.

Installation
------------

If you get the code from a release tarball, you'll probably just need to
do the usual:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Assuming you have Gtk+\>3.4, libgee and libvala.

If you get the code from the git repository, you'll also need a vala
compiler and the autotools, and to run

    $ ./autogen.sh

before the steps abote.

Running
-------

Simply typing:

    $ tnt

should launch a new game if you just installed it, or resume your
previous game if you already played (only the scores are saved at the
end of each game, though).

Playing
-------

See the rules on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French\_tarot

GUI is pretty basic: click on a card to play it or select/unselect it
for your dog. Click the "OK" button at the end of the turn. The name of
the player name who took is displayed in red (with skulls), the name of
the one who won the precedent turn is displayed in blue. Some messages
also appear at the right to give you some information about who
distributes or what are the bids and scores.
