Card pictures are taken from the cardpic project
(http://www.nongnu.org/cardpics/), by Guillaume Weexsten and Yves
Mettier. 

"Marseille" card pictures were also taken from the cardpic project,
but trumps have been modified adding pictures from the classical major
arcana of Tarot de Marseille, by Jean Dodal, which are in public domain.
